# Solar_CostCurves
Scripts used to generate results as published in the journal Nature Climate Change titled 'Climate change impacts on renewable energy supply'. 

A large part is developed by Monique Hoogwijk, see: Hoogwijk MM. On the global and regional potential of renewable energy sources [PhD]. Universiteit Utrecht, Faculteit Scheikunde; 2004.

The main script is solar_cc.m. To run that model with the ISIMIP data it was made as a function called solar_cc_ISIMIP.m and activated using the script Run_Solar_ISIMIP.m.
